# Utilities

## Configure logging

ðŸ¤— Datasets strives to be transparent and explicit about how it works, but this can be quite verbose at times. We have included a series of logging methods which allow you to easily adjust the level of verbosity of the entire library. Currently the default verbosity of the library is set to `WARNING`.

To change the level of verbosity, use one of the direct setters. For instance, here is how to change the verbosity to the `INFO` level:

```py
import datasets
datasets.logging.set_verbosity_info()
```

You can also use the environment variable `DATASETS_VERBOSITY` to override the default verbosity, and set it to one of the following: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`:

```bash
DATASETS_VERBOSITY=error ./myprogram.py
```

All the methods of this logging module are documented below. The main ones are:

- [`logging.get_verbosity`] to get the current level of verbosity in the logger
- [`logging.set_verbosity`] to set the verbosity to the level of your choice

In order from the least to the most verbose (with their corresponding `int` values):

1. `logging.CRITICAL` or `logging.FATAL` (int value, 50): only report the most critical errors.
2. `logging.ERROR` (int value, 40): only report errors.
3. `logging.WARNING` or `logging.WARN` (int value, 30): only reports error and warnings. This the default level used by the library.
4. `logging.INFO` (int value, 20): reports error, warnings and basic information.
5. `logging.DEBUG` (int value, 10): report all information.

```python
def get_verbosity() -> int:
```

Return the current level for the HuggingFace datasets library's root logger.
    Returns:
        Logging level, e.g., `datasets.logging.DEBUG` and `datasets.logging.INFO`.

    <Tip>

        HuggingFace datasets library has following logging levels:
        - `datasets.logging.CRITICAL`, `datasets.logging.FATAL`
        - `datasets.logging.ERROR`
        - `datasets.logging.WARNING`, `datasets.logging.WARN`
        - `datasets.logging.INFO`
        - `datasets.logging.DEBUG`

    </Tip>

```python
def set_verbosity(verbosity: int) -> None:
```

Set the level for the Hugging Face Datasets library's root logger.
    Args:
        verbosity:
            Logging level, e.g., `datasets.logging.DEBUG` and `datasets.logging.INFO`.

```python
def set_verbosity(verbosity: int) -> None:
```

Set the level for the Hugging Face Datasets library's root logger.
    Args:
        verbosity:
            Logging level, e.g., `datasets.logging.DEBUG` and `datasets.logging.INFO`._info

```python
def set_verbosity(verbosity: int) -> None:
```

Set the level for the Hugging Face Datasets library's root logger.
    Args:
        verbosity:
            Logging level, e.g., `datasets.logging.DEBUG` and `datasets.logging.INFO`._warning

```python
def set_verbosity(verbosity: int) -> None:
```

Set the level for the Hugging Face Datasets library's root logger.
    Args:
        verbosity:
            Logging level, e.g., `datasets.logging.DEBUG` and `datasets.logging.INFO`._debug

```python
def set_verbosity(verbosity: int) -> None:
```

Set the level for the Hugging Face Datasets library's root logger.
    Args:
        verbosity:
            Logging level, e.g., `datasets.logging.DEBUG` and `datasets.logging.INFO`._error

```python
def disable_propagation() -> None:
```

Disable propagation of the library log outputs.
    Note that log propagation is disabled by default.

```python
def enable_propagation() -> None:
```

Enable propagation of the library log outputs.
    Please disable the Hugging Face datasets library's default handler to prevent double logging if the root logger has
    been configured.

## Configure progress bars

By default, `tqdm` progress bars will be displayed during dataset download and preprocessing. You can disable them globally by setting `HF_DATASETS_DISABLE_PROGRESS_BARS`
environment variable. You can also enable/disable them using [`~utils.enable_progress_bars`] and [`~utils.disable_progress_bars`]. If set, the environment variable has priority on the helpers.

```python
def enable_progress_bars() -> None:
```

Enable globally progress bars used in `datasets` except if `HF_DATASETS_DISABLE_PROGRESS_BAR` environment
    variable has been set.

    Use [`~utils.disable_progress_bars`] to disable them.

```python
def disable_progress_bars() -> None:
```

Disable globally progress bars used in `datasets` except if `HF_DATASETS_DISABLE_PROGRESS_BAR` environment
    variable has been set.

    Use [`~utils.enable_progress_bars`] to re-enable them.

```python
def are_progress_bars_disabled() -> bool:
```

Return whether progress bars are globally disabled or not.

    Progress bars used in `datasets` can be enable or disabled globally using [`~utils.enable_progress_bars`]
    and [`~utils.disable_progress_bars`] or by setting `HF_DATASETS_DISABLE_PROGRESS_BAR` as environment variable.
